# Scoreboards Information
This README explains how to use the scoreboard system in the new Practice Core system.

## Table of Contents
[TOC]

## Scoreboard Types
The default scoreboard types that are used by the internal Practice Core plugin are:

- `scoreboard.spawn.default` - Used when a  player is at spawn and not in a queue.
- `scoreboard.ffa` - Used when a player is in a FFA arena.

**DO NOT EDIT THE SCOREBOARD TYPE NAMES IN SCOREBOARDS.YML FILE, IF YOU DO, THE SCOREBOARDS WILL NOT WORK.**

## Editing the Display
You can change what the scoreboards display and which
line number they display on by changing the current line number under the scoreboard that you want to edit.

**Example:**
```yaml
scoreboard.spawn:
	line-1: "Line 1"
	line-2: "Line 2"
```

**DISCLAIMER:** The maximum of lines on a scoreboard is 15. **ANY LINE NUMBER PAST 15 WILL NOT SHOW UP ON THE SCOREBOARD**

 ---
You can also change the text on the corresponding line on the scoreboard.

**Example:**
```yaml
scoreboard.spawn:
	line-1: "Line 1"
	line-2: "Online-Players"
```

---
You can also add empty lines to the scoreboard by setting the content inside of them as "".

**Example:**
```yaml
scoreboard.spawn:
    line-1: "Line 1"
    # Empty line on line 2.
    line-2: ""
    line-3: "Online-Players"
```

---
You can add color to the scoreboard lines by providing the color name based on the list.

**Example:**
```yaml
scoreboard.spawn:
    line-1: "{BLUE}Line 1"
    line-2: "{RED}Online-Players{RESET}"
```
Here is the list of all the colors you can use:

`{BLUE} {GREEN} {RED} {DARK_RED} {DARK_BLUE} 
{DARK_AQUA} {DARK_GREEN} {GOLD} {GRAY} {DARK_GRAY}
{DARK_PURPLE} {LIGHT_PURPLE} {YELLOW} {AQUA}
{BOLD} {WHITE}`

More line effects:

- `{RESET}` - Resets the colors of the text.
- `{BOLD}` - Makes the text bold.
- `{ITALIC}` - Makes the text italicized.
- `{UNDERLINE}` - Underlines the text.

## Displaying Statistics
There are certain statistics that you can display on a given line by using a set of curly-braces and defining the type of statistic that you want to display.

**Example:**
```yaml
scoreboard.spawn:
	# Displays how many online-players there are.
	line-1: " Online-Players: {stat.online.players} "
```

** DISCLAIMER: ** Certain statistics only work when the player is in a certain scenario or has a specific scoreboard type.
